# Welcome to Open Applied Topology at PNNL!

Welcome the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) central repository for Open Applied Topology (OAT)!

OAT is a collection of open-source software packages for applied topology. Each package has a folder in this repository, and has a separate, stand-alone repository:

- OAT-Rust [oat_rust_pnnl](https://github.com/pnnl/oat_rust_pnnl)
- OAT-Python [oat_python_pnnl](https://github.com/pnnl/oat_python_pnnl)
- SOHAR-Rust [sohar_rust_pnnl](https://github.com/pnnl/sohar_rust_pnnl)
- SOHAR-Python [sohar_python_pnnl](https://github.com/pnnl/sohar_python_pnnl)
- Introduction to Rust [introduction_to_rust_pnnl](https://github.com/pnnl/introduction_to_rust_pnnl)

See each package's README for installation instructions.
